# Fitville Shoes x Andrew Fraser — Script v2

*(60-90 seconds)*

I've walked through markets, temples, mountains — you name it — and the one thing I've learned is that your shoes can make or break a trip.

These are the Fitville Rebound Neos, and honestly, the first thing you notice is the wide toe box. Your feet aren't crammed in — they can actually spread out and move naturally. That alone is a game changer when you're on your feet all day.

They've also got proper arch support built in, so even after ten, twelve hours of walking, my feet aren't destroyed. It genuinely feels like walking on clouds compared to most shoes I've worn on the road.
