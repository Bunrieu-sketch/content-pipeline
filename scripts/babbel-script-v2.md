# Babbel x Andrew Fraser — Script v2

So I've been traveling through Indonesia for the past few weeks, and honestly one of the best things I did before coming here was brushing up on a little bit of Bahasa.

One thing I've learned from traveling to so many countries is that you don't need a lot of language to really get by. Even just a few words completely changes the experience — people open up, you get invited places tourists never see. There's honestly no more rewarding way to get more out of your travel.

That's why I've been using Babbel. Stuff like "Berapa harganya?" — "how much is this?" — or just being able to say thanks properly. Babbel is one of the top language learning apps in the world, and their lessons are built by real language teachers, so you're learning phrases you'll actually use. I was having basic conversations in like three weeks.
